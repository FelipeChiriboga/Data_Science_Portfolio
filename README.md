# Data_Science_Portfolio

Data Science Portfolio is a file where I try to place different types of datasets and 
work with them doing data analysis and trying to improve my data management skills


## Libraries normally used:

```python

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

```

The main goal is to work with these different datasets doing data wrangling to improve my skills in data analysis
and the understanding of how to use different libraries and different approaches depending in what king of datasets
we are using.
